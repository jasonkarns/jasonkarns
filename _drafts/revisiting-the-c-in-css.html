<p>While working on another user style, I ran into a peculiarity between Firefox+Stylish and Chrome+Stylish that I hadn't dealt with in a while. An author's rule with lower specificity was overriding my user-style rule (which had higher specificity), but only in Firefox. The answer lies in the cascading rules in CSS.</p>
<p>Most developers are aware of the specificity rules which govern how style conflicts are resolved. (see <a href="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/cssadvanced/specificity/">specificity</a>) However, we all tend to forget how the precedence of different style <em>sheets</em> is determined. Here's a refresher. In ascending order of precedence:</p>
<ol>
<li>User Agent</li>
<li>User declarations (normal)</li>
<li>Author declarations (normal)
<ol>
<li>External style sheets</li>
<li>Embedded style declarations</li>
<li>Inline style declarations</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Author declarations (important)
<ol>
<li>External style sheets</li>
<li>Embedded style declarations</li>
<li>Inline style declarations</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>User declarations (important)</li>
</ol>
<p>This cascade supersedes any specificity rankings. Thus,</p>
