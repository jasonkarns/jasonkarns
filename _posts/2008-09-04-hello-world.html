<p>So, I've been meaning to set up a blog for some time now.  And this is finally it.  Obviously the theme leaves more to be desired, and there will be quite a bit of tweaking and over-hauling; but it's a start.  Soon there will be posts galore, from JavaScript and jQuery, to Microformats, .NET, and PHP.</p>
<p>See you 'round.</p>
