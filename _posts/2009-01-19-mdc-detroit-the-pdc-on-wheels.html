<p>In a couple of days (this Thursday, January 22<sup>nd</sup>) I'll be heading up to <a href="http://msdndevcon.com/Pages/Detroit.aspx">Detroit, Michigan </a>for the <a href="http://msdndevcon.com/Pages/start.aspx">MSDN Developer Conference </a>as it makes its way through the heartland.  But not only will I be attending, my colleague <a href="http://www.jeffreyhunsaker.com/">Jeff Hunsaker</a> and I have the great pleasure of speaking at the MDC! We will be introducing <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery </a>and showing how ASP.NET AJAX and jQuery can <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/jQuerytoshipwithASPNETMVCandVisualStudio.aspx">work together</a>. Many of you have of course heard the not-so-recent <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/09/28/jquery-and-microsoft.aspx">news </a>(a few months on the internet is like a lifetime) that Microsoft will be '<a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2008/09/28/jquery-microsoft-nokia/">adopting</a>' jQuery which will ship with future versions of Visual Studio. So if you live anywhere near Detroit and would like to see how jQuery fits into ASP.NET, (or are interested in any of the <a href="http://msdndevcon.com/Pages/sessions.aspx#cloudServices">other</a> <a href="http://msdndevcon.com/Pages/sessions.aspx#ClientandP">cool</a> <a href="http://msdndevcon.com/Pages/sessions.aspx#Tools">topics </a>and presentations you might have missed from the PDC) come check out the MDC! Also be sure to check out <a href="http://www.jeffreyhunsaker.com/2009/01/mdc-detroit-introducing-jquery-in.html">Jeff's blog post</a> on our presentation. He's included loads of related links and info.</p>
