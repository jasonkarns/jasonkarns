<p>I'm a big fan of Gmail and Google Reader. I generally leave these tabs (along with Google Calendar) open all day long. To minimize the amount of visual space these long-lived tabs consume in the tab bar, I use the great <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3780">FaviconizeTab</a> extension. However, with these tabs minified, you lose the ability to be notified visually (via the title text) of new mail or new posts. A simple solution that I found years ago was to write a simple user style to change the background color of the tab whenever a new item arrives. It's a great simple solution that doesn't require any new programs or extensions. For those of you who use the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108">Stylish</a> extension, I've finally gotten around to posting this style to <a href="http://userstyles.org/">userstyles.org</a> so installation is dead-simple. This style also works well with the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8121">Badges on Favicon</a> extension which actually displays the number of unread items via small 'badge' on the tab. Go ahead and <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/14571">grab the style</a> now! I've posted a <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/14572">Firefox 1.5 - 2.0 compatible version</a> as well. (But seriously, if you're not using Firefox 3, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">upgrade now</a>!)</p>
