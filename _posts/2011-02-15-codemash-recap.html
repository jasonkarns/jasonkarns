<p>I can't honestly call this a recap or an overview because there is just too much good stuff to do CodeMash proper justice. And I clearly waited too long to do a 'best of' or 'highlights' post. However, after attempting to give a recap of CodeMash to my fellow <abbr title="Cardinal Solutions Group-ers">CSGers</abbr>, I had a list of talking points and recommended resources that shouldn't be put to waste. I'm omitting the two mini-demos that I gave during my recap: git-bisect and BDD/Cucumber. So you'll have to research those on your own. Seriously, go try git-bisect. It's cool.</p>
<p>So it was clearly impossible to recap 72 hours of awesome in 1 hour. Not to  mention the drinking, water slides, etc. So here are a few resources you ought  to check out while you're sitting on the couch with your wife suffering through  American Idol this season.</p>
<h2>Reasons why CodeMash is awesome</h2>
<ol>
<li>The tiki hut/bars.</li>
<li>Waterslides. In Sandusky. In January.</li>
<li>Hot-tub snowball fights; lacking only a time machine.</li>
<li>Aside from the numerous presentations, there are great open spaces that spring up. These lead to great discussions and they're completely ad-hoc. I participated in one covering node.js (check out the #nodemash tag on Twitter)</li>
<li>You'll see people pairing all over the place in corners, empty rooms, hallway couches. They're working on mini-projects, trying out demos, and  generally experimenting; usually inspired by a talk, keynote, or open  space.</li>
<li>You can attend a deep dive on Parallel Programming in .NET and then  see an intro to UX design, followed by BDD with Cucumber, topped off with HTML5  and offline webdev. One of the best things about CodeMash is the range of  languages, platforms, and technologies. You can meet people doing awesome stuff  in Java or Flex, and pick up a few testing tricks from the Ruby dudes. Even within just the .NET world, there was VB, C#, F#, and IronRuby.</li>
<li>Did I  mention the after-parties?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Things to check out</h2>
<ul>
<li>Suggested during  Chad Fowler's (of the Pragmatic Programmers) 'Quality' keynote, read 'Zen and  the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance'. Since hearing Chad mention it during his keynote, I've heard this book recommended 3 other times. It's definitely on my to-read list.</li>
<li>Slightly related to Scott Chacon's (of  GitHub) <a href="http://schacon.github.com/ddd/#1">keynote</a>, be sure to watch the  <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html">'Surprising Science Behind Motivation' TED talk</a></li>
<li>Step-by-step introduction to Git by EdgeCase: <a href="http://library.edgecase.com/git_immersion/">Git Immersion</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stevesmithblog.s3.amazonaws.com/CodeMash2011PrecompilerSoftwareCraftsmanship.zip">Try your hand  at a few Katas</a> used in the Craftsmanship PreCompiler.<br />
For an extra challenge, try them in  a few different languages. For instance, during the PreCompiler I did the  PrimeFactors Kata in JavaScript, Java, and C#</li>
<li>A good number of talks have <a href="http://blog.alner.net/archive/2011/01/17/codemash_slide_links.aspx">posted links to their slides and/or demos</a>. I recommend:

<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee309512.aspx">Functional Programming for Everyday .NET Development</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tinyurl.com/TakingWebAppsOffline">Taking Web Applications Offline with HTML5, Silverlight and AIR</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/timwingfield/SlideDecks/tree/master/Codemash.2011">Executable  Requirements: Testing in the Language of the Business</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jimweirich/presentation_testing_why_dont_we_do_it_like_this">Are You Satisfied With Your  Tests?</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested in going next  year, be prepared. They sold out in just 3 days this year. That's right: the conference itself lasted longer than the ticket sales.</p>
