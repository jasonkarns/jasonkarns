<p>Are you forced to use Lotus Notes at work? Do you prefer Google Calendar? Would you like to have your Lotus Notes calendar synced to your Google calendar? Solution: CalSync!</p>
<p>CalSync is a great little utility that runs in the background and automatically syncs your Lotus Notes calendar with Google Calendar. You can <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lntogoogle/">download it from SourceForge</a>. It's a standalone application that doesn't require installation. Simply extract the zip file into a directory of your choosing and open the executable. You'll need to provide you Lotus Notes account information, as well as your Google account information. (I recommend using Google's 2-factor authentication and setting up an application-specific password for CalSync.)</p>

<p>After providing your account information, you can configure how you would like it to sync with Google Calendar. Personally, I recommend creating a new Google Calendar that is dedicated to syncing with your Lotus Notes calendar.</p>

<p>There are plenty of additional configuration options to customize how/when your calendar items are synced. And, of course, to have it start with windows, simply add a shortcut to CalSync to your Startup folder. Now you can get your Lotus Notes work calendar on your smartphone via Google!</p>
