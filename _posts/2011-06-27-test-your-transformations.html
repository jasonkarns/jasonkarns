<p>Web.config transforms are a really great tool for setting up environment-specific configuration files. However, the transform syntax can be a bit obscure, and tracking down configuration bugs is just painful.</p>
<p>For this, there is a <a href="http://webconfigtransformationtester.apphb.com/">great testing tool hosted on AppHarbor</a>. Paste in your web.config contents in one box, drop in your transform in another and out comes the transformed web.config. Never waste time messing with your web.config transforms again!</p>
