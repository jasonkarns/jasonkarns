<p>As may be clear by <a href="https://github.com/jasonkarns/ubiquitycommands">my ubiquitycommands github repository</a>, I am an avid Ubiquity user. So much so, in fact, that I delayed upgrading to Firefox 5 until I was able to find a version of Ubiquity that works with Firefox 5. Wonder of wonders, I have found that version.</p>
<p>Satyr Murky continues to work on a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/satyr/ubiquity">community-maintained fork</a> of the <a href="http://mozillalabs.com/ubiquity">original Mozilla.org version</a> of Ubiquity. Luckily for us, it works in Firefox 5.</p>
<p>Thank you, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/satyr">Satyr</a>!</p>
